#  React Phaser Game

This project is a simple Phaser 3 game integrated into a React app. The goal was to follow the provided steps to build a game with a start button, make it responsive, and configure UI elements dynamically.

##  Features Implemented
- Created a **React app** with TypeScript.
- Added a **start button** that appears before and after the game ends.
- Styled the button using a **configuration file (`button-config.ts`)**.
- Adjusted the buttonâ€™s position so it appears over the game.

## Known Limitations
- **Phaser game logic** is not fully implemented.
- **Game responsiveness** needs more improvements.
- **Start button functionality** is working, but further refinements are needed.

##  What I Learned
- **Integrating Phaser 3** with a React application.
- **Dynamically configuring UI elements** using TypeScript.
- **Managing button visibility** based on game state.
- Improved my **understanding of game development concepts**.
